# Simple REST CRUD testing program

### Using example

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to do REST requests
2. Create POST request by adding JSON Body and send it to [http://localhost:8080/clients/](http://localhost:8080/clients/), for example:
    

    {
        "name" : "Peter",
        "email" : "petermail@mail.com",
        "phone" : "+15672552356"
    }
